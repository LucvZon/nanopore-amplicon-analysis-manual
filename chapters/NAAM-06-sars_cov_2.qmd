# SARS-CoV-2 analysis

If you are dealing with SARS-Cov-2 data, then you can run the [pangolin software](https://github.com/cov-lineages/pangolin) to submit your SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences which then are compared with other genome sequences and assigned the most likely lineage.

Execute the following:
```bash
pangolin {input} --outfile {output}
```

- `{input}` is your aggregated consensus fasta file from step X.X.
- `{output}` is a .csv file that contains taxon name and lineage assigned per fasta sequence. Read more about the output format: [https://cov-lineages.org/resources/pangolin/output.html](https://cov-lineages.org/resources/pangolin/output.html)


## To be added...

Here are some of the snakemake rules that are currently excluded:

- create_depth_file
- create_vcf
- annotate_vcf
- filter_vcf
- create_filtered_vcf_tables

These rules are exclusively for analysis of SARS-Cov-2 data and will be implemented into the container workflow in the near future.
