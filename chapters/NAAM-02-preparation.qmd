## 1.1 Singularity container {.unnumbered}

This workflow is distributed as a self-contained Singularity container image, which includes all necessary software dependencies and helper scripts. This simplifies setup considerably. It is required that [Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.5/user-guide/introduction.html){target="_blank"} version 3.x or later is available on your system. If you are working with a high performance computing (HPC) system, then this will likely already be installed and available for use. Try writing `singularity --help` in your terminal (that's connected to the HPC system) and see if the command is recognized.

### Download pre-built image

The singularity container needs an image file to activate the precompiled work environment. You can download the required workflow image file (naam_workflow.sif) directly through the terminal via:

``` bash
wget https://github.com/LucvZon/nanopore-amplicon-analysis-manual/releases/download/v1.1.1/naam_workflow.sif
```

Or go to the [github page](https://github.com/LucvZon/nanopore-amplicon-analysis-manual/releases/tag/v1.1.1){target="_blank"} and manually download it there, then transfer it to your HPC system.

### 1.2 Verify container {.unnumbered}

You can test basic execution:

``` bash
singularity --version
singularity exec naam_workflow.sif echo "Container is accessible!"
```

To check more in depth, you can start an interactive shell inside the build container and run some checks. `singularity shell naam_workflow.sif` will drop you into a shell running inside the container. The conda environment needed for this workflow is automatically active on start-up of the interactive shell. All the tools of the conda environment will therefore be ready to use.

Please note that you do not have to run `conda activate {environment}` to activate the environment â€“ everything is inside naam_workflow.sif. If you're curious about the conda environment we're using, you can check it out [here](https://github.com/LucvZon/nanopore-amplicon-analysis-manual/blob/main/envs/environment.yml){target="_blank"}

``` bash
singularity shell naam_workflow.sif # Start interactive shell
minimap2 --help # Check one of the tools from the conda environment
which python # Check python version of the conda environment
```

We are now ready to start executing the code to perform quality control of our raw Nanopore sequencing data in the next chapter.
