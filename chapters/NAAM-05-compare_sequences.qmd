# Comparing sequence to reference sequences

## Creating multiple sequence alignment

We can now create a multiple sequence alignment (MAF). (Not to be confused with a read alignment .bam file).

We can use a reference based multiple sequence alignment approach with minimap2 and gofasta. This is very fast and works well even for large genomes (e.g. 200kb+) or many sequences (10,000+). However, gofasta does not perform a “real” multiple alignment, because it ignores insertions in the sequences compared to the reference and removes them. Therefore if insertions are expected and present in the sequences, they will have to be added manually. On the positive side, phylogenetic analysis tools, such as [IQTREE2](https://github.com/iqtree/iqtree2), also ignore any insertions, so for the phylogenetic analysis the removal of insertions does not matter.

``` bash
minimap2 -t {threads} -a \
-x asm20 \
--sam-hit-only \
--secondary=no \
--score-N=0 \
{reference} \
{input} \
-o tmp.sam

gofasta sam toMultiAlign \
-s tmp.sam \
-o {output}
```

- `{input}` here is the `.fasta` file containing all consensus sequences and references you would like to align.
- `{output}` is the name of the aligned fasta file (e.g. `consensus_with_ref_aligned.fasta`). 
- `{reference}` is the reference used to performe a reference based multiple alignment, use the same reference as we used for read mapping before.

(`tmp.sam` can be deleted)

## Generate useful stats

You can generate read stats with `seqkit stats -T` for the raw, QC, trimmed and mapped reads.

```bash
seqkit stats -T {input} > {output}
```

If want to check the read stats for a mapping file, you can use the following:

```bash
for file in {input}; do
    samtools fastq $file | seqkit stats -T --stdin-label $file | tail -1
done > {output}
```

- `{input}` is your mapping file.
- `{output}` is a tab separated file .tsv with the read stats.
